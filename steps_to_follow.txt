1. Add crome extension to download images by below URL
https://bit.ly/3nXfPI8

2. Download rename files jupyter notebook form below link paste in in the same folder where you 
placed all the images run it all all the image files will be renamed 

https://github.com/jakkcoder/training_yolo_custom_object_detection_files/blob/main/Rename_files.ipynb


2.1 Download labelImg tool with below link 
https://tzutalin.github.io/labelImg/

3. git link to clone darknet on colab
https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet

4. Get train and test data generator from here 
https://github.com/jakkcoder/training_yolo_custom_object_detection_files

Note for point 4 :- I am not the authors for 2 py files complete credit goes to authors for 
 creating-files-data-and-name, creating-train-and-test-txt-files files.

5. Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers (154 MB): 
 http://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74 

6.  command to train the model (take care of single line and spaces)

!darknet/darknet detector train custom_data/labelled_data.data darknet/cfg/yolov3_custom.cfg 
custom_weight/darknet53.conv.74 -dont_show

7. Download code to use trained model to detect object on live video
https://github.com/jakkcoder/training_yolo_custom_object_detection_files



In this tutorial I’m going to explain you one of the easiest way to train YOLO to detect a custom object even if you’re a beginner and have no experience with coding.

This video cover:
1. Setting up Google Colab as a cloud VM with Free GPU.
2. Commands to get Darknet with YOLOv3 weights installed and running.
3. YOLOv3 pretrained coco model detections in the Cloud.
4. Configuration for Custom YOLOv3 Training in the Cloud.
5. Training Custom YOLOv3 Object Detector in the Cloud.
